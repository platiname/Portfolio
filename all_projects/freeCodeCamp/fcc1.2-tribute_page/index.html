            <li><span class="bold">1875 - Tesla Enrolled at Austrian Polytechnic</span><br /> <span class="indent">In 1875, Tesla began to study engineering at the Austrian Polytechnic in Graz, Austria. He claimed to have graduated, but the institution disagrees.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1882 - Worked for Continental Edison</span><br /> <span class="indent">In 1882, he went to work for Continental Edison in Paris. He was attempting to improve on electrical equipment sent from the United States.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1882 - Identified Magnetic Induction Field Principle</span><br /> <span class="indent">Working independently, Tesla identified the rotating magnetic induction field principle. This is used today in alternators.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1884 - Moved to United States</span><br /> <span class="indent">Tesla moved to the United States in 1884, immediately approaching Thomas Edison with a letter of introduction.

            <li><span class="bold">1885 - Nikola Tesla Quit Working for Edison</span><br /> <span class="indent">After Edison refused to pay, Tesla quit working for Edison, with the plan and intention of starting his own electrical company.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1886 - Began Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing</span><br /> <span class="indent"> Tesla founded the Tesla Electric Light and Manufacturing Company in Rahway, New Jersey. He invented and marketed an arc lamp; however, he earned relatively little off of his investment.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1887 - War of Currents</span><br /> <span class="indent"> The War of Currents began in 1887. Direct current, invented and supported by Edison, was in direct competition with Tesla's alternating current.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1891 - Patented Tesla Coil</span><br /> <span class="indent"> In 1891, Tesla patented the Tesla Coil. The Tesla Coil is a resonant transformer circuit that produced a high voltage, low current and high frequency alternating current electricity.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1891 - Columbian Exhibition</span><br /> <span class="indent"> With the support of the Westinghouse Company, Tesla's alternating current powered the World's Columbian Exhibition. Tesla had offered a lower cost electrical solution.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1901 - Construction on Wardenclyffe Tower Began</span><br /> <span class="indent"> In 1901, construction began on the Wardenclyffe Tower. Tesla believed that he could transmit electrical energy over long distances wirelessly, and the tower would illustrate that. The project was never fully completed.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1915 - Files Suit Against Guglielmo Marconi</span><br /> <span class="indent"> On August 4, 1915, Tesla filed suit against Guglielmo Marconi. Marconi is typically credited with radio transmission; however, Tesla accomplished this before Marconi.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1934 - Particle Beam Research</span><br /> <span class="indent"> In 1934, the New York Times published Tesla's particle beam research. While he was not financially successful, he continued to be a relatively prominent voice in the scientific community.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">January 7, 1943 - Tesla Died</span><br /> <span class="indent"> On January 7, 1943, as World War II raged, Nikola Tesla died in the hotel he made his home. Upon his death, the U.S. government immediately seized his papers and research.</span></li>
            <li><span class="bold">1960 - A Tesla Was Defined as a Unit of Measurement</span><br /> <span class="indent"> In 1960, the scientific community recognized Tesla's achievements by defining a Tesla as a unit of measurement. A Tesla is a unit of magnetic field B.<span></li>
